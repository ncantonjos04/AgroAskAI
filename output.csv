**Rainwater Harvesting Systems**
- **System Types**: 
  - **Gutter Systems**: Set up gutters along rooftops to channel rainwater into storage tanks.
  - **Underground Tanks**: These can be installed to store larger quantities of harvested rainwater, ideal for larger farms.
  - **Rain Barrels**: For smaller farms or gardens, using rain barrels connected to downspouts can be effective.

- **Maintenance Tips**: 
  - Clean gutters and filters monthly to prevent blockages.
  - Inspect the integrity of storage tanks for leaks and ensure they are covered to prevent evaporation and contamination.
  - Regularly check and maintain the system, especially before and during the rainy season to ensure efficiency.

Implementing rainwater harvesting can significantly improve water availability during critical growing periods, helping farmers to sustain their crops and livestock in times of drought.
